    \n    I will give up
    \n    Flying in house
    \n    I am a ghost
    \n    I will give up
  \n
  \n OK, let  see what\'s happened earlier
  \n I\'ve heard from the speech to the \n police guy
  \n He wondered how the car was crashed
  \n She is OK, the man\'s brain\'s smashed
  \n It\'s hard to say but i will tell you
  \n All the facts that happened on my eyes
  \n Oh damn it is so hard to say OK
  \n He was my boyfriend it was his car
  \n He gave me to drive he gave me to try
  \n I\'m not experienced at it but have the \n licence of driving
  \n He told to me to speed up to hurry up that \n I should pass crossroad on green light
  \n Just push the gas he cried
  \n I\'m scared and terrified whole life \n was passing through my eyes
  \n My body didn\'t hear me he took by the \n force the steering wheel
  \n The car had turned in other way begin \n to wave begin to shake
  \n Oh shit it\'s so god damn hard to say \n but boyfriend\'s slained because of tree
  \n Please just go out just let me in
  \n I want to play the woman feeling
  \n It was really me?
  \n
  \n    I will give up
  \n    You never gonna see me
  \n    Flying in house
  \n    Apartments we were dreaming
  \n    I am a ghost
  \n    In who you don\'t believe in
  \n    I will give up
  \n
  \n  How dare am i crashed my life \n my love is sad
  \n  I had to take response for that \n i made all this shit
  \n  But now i am the ghost post \n death syndrome, loss of the speech
  \n  I am a ghost in who she don\'t \n believe the most
  \n  But stop people she smiles alone why
  \n  She fully was crying before the policemen
  \n  And now she\'s just sitting and smiling \n and texting, sending some nude cards of her
  \n  I remember it all
  \n  It was fine day i had to say we were going \n to visit empire state
  \n  Building and roof i wasn\'t smooth \n enough to make a move
  \n  I\'m am so trustful i\'m in love
  \n  I don\'t believe in other guy texting \n and flirting with darling
  \n  Now i can see it\'s Darwin
  \n  So i saw the text on a phone \n she was rolling on the road
  \n  I asked who the fuck is Darwin
  \n  She mutely turned the car out the road \n ha-ha oh shit you left me for the dead
  \n  My side a car had crashed into \n the holly fucking larch
  \n  I\'m dead
  \n
  \n  I will give up
  \n  You never gonna see me
  \n  Flying in house
  \n  Apartments we were dreaming
  \n  I am a ghost
  \n  In who you don\'t believe in
  \n  I will give up \n  I will give up
